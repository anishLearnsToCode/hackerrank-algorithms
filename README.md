# HackerRank Algorithms Solutions
HackerRank is an online platform that offers programmers the ability to test their
sills, practice and learn something new. 

The problem sets on HackerRank are divided in Domains and the following are the domains
on HackerRank:

1. [Algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms)
2. [Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures)
3. [Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics) 
4. [C](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/c)
5. [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)
6. [Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java)
7. [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
8. [Ruby](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ruby)
9. [Linux Shell](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell)
10. [Functional Programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
11. [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
12. [SQL](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)
13. [Databases](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/databases)
14. [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)

This repository contains solutions to the Data Structures domain part of HackerRank. My
HackerRank profile can be viewed [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/anishviewer).

The Algorithms Domain Falls under a broader Problem Solving Skill Set in HackerRank
which consists of both 
[Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures) 
and [Algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms).

The Algorithms Domain is further Divided into the following sub-domain. All
problems in this domain have been solved with the Java programming language, but I am 
open to the pull requests that provides solutions to these problems in other languages
as well such as Python, JavaScript, TypeScript (even Lisp!)....
